    "0": "Let us start with the new chapter today. The new chapter that we are going to start after application of derivatives is integrals or integration. Now, this is also under the calculus unit and it is very important because the next two chapters are based on this only. So, integration or integrals, what is it? How is it related to the previous chapter of differentiation? Let us see. I start with an example. Suppose, I have been given a function Y and it is x raised to the power 4. Now, Y is equal to x raised to the power 4. What is my dy by dx? It is nothing but 4xQ that you must know. Next example that I take. Again, I have a function Y this time it is xR4 plus 4. What is dy by dx? My dy by dx is equal to 4xQ. Next again, one example. Let us see. I have my Y is equal to x4 minus 2. What is my dy by dx?",
    "1": "That is equal to 4xQ. So, what do you observe in these examples? You see that irrespective of whatever I const, whatever constant I add or subtract to x raised to the power 4. I get the same result 4xQ, 4xQ, 4xQ. That means what? That means, 4xQ is there which is the answer that comes when I differentiate the given function x raised to the power 4 or x raised to the power 4 plus something some constant or x raised to the power 4 minus some constant. Even this can be written as x raised to the power 4 plus of minus 2. So, whatever function is given to you, I am talking about a function fx. If I differentiate it to get f dash x and f dash x I observe is coming out",
    "2": "to be the same even if I have different functions. That means, there is something or the other which is more of depth in differentiation. So, now the reverse process of differentiation is called as integration. The reverse process of differentiation I repeat is called as integration. That means, if I have 4xQ obtaining x raised to the power 4 from 4xQ or obtaining x raised to the power 4 plus 4 or obtaining x raised to the power 4 minus 2 from 4xQ is called as my integration. That is it, that is the base. So, that means, I will be having f dash x and I would want to obtain fx my",
    "3": "function from f dash x that we are going to see in this chapter. This is the overview of this chapter. The other thing, now if I have been given say 4xQ, I know that the answer could either be x raised to the power 4 or x raised to the power 4 plus 4 or x raised to the power 4 minus 2 or x raised to the power 4 minus 1 or x raised to the power 4 plus 1 by 2 whatever the function was all would give me 4xQ. That means, x raised to the power 4 is fixed x raised to the power 4 does not change it will be there only, but if x raised to the power 4 only is there that is a problem because what about all these answers then. So, the answer would be x raised to the power 4 plus any constant that arbitrary constant can be anything it can be 1 minus 1 it can be 1 by 2 it can be minus 1 by 2 and so on. So, that is important that what is the constant that we do not know",
    "4": "it can be any arbitrary constant. So, I have to add plus c to all my answers in integration the first thing and integration is also called as anti derivative because you are basically going for the reverse process of differentiation. It is also called as primitive. So, these words are also important because everybody will remember integration and differentiation, but people forget these names and when they come in the exam they do not know what to do. So, anti derivative and primitive is the other word the next important thing that you have to know is always this arbitrary constant would not be added. We are going to study two types of integration here one is your indifinate. Indifinate integration would have this arbitrary constant which is known as constant of integration. The other that we are going to study is definite in the later course of the",
